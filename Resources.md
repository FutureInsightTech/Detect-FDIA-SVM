## Features of Data Set:
- Session ID: A unique identifier for each charging session that can be used for tracking purposes.
- Kwh Total: The total amount of energy consumed by the EV during the charging session, which is a crucial data point for analyzing energy consumption patterns.
- Dollar: The cost of the charging session, which can be used to analyze the economic feasibility of P2P energy trading.
- Created: The time and date when the charging session started, which can be used to analyze temporal patterns in EV charging behavior.
- Ended: The time and date when the charging session ended, which can also be used to analyze temporal patterns in EV charging behavior.
- Starting time: The starting time of the charging session in hours and minutes, which can be used to further analyze temporal patterns in EV charging behavior.
- Ending time: The ending time of the charging session in hours and minutes, which can also be used to further analyze temporal patterns in EV charging behavior.
- Charging time: The duration of the charging session in minutes, which can be used to calculate the charging speed and to analyze the duration of EV charging sessions.
- Weekday: The day of the week when the charging session took place, which can be used to analyze weekly patterns in EV charging behavior.
- User ID: The unique identifier for the EV driver using the charging station, which can be used to track individual behavior and to analyze the energy consumption behavior of different user groups.
- Station ID: The unique identifier for the charging station, which can be used to analyze the energy consumption behavior of different charging stations.
- Location ID: The unique identifier for the location of the charging station, which can be used to analyze the energy consumption behavior of different locations and to evaluate the feasibility of P2P energy trading based on the availability of renewable energy sources.
