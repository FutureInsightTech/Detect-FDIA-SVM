# Working Process:
## Steps:
These steps are used to create and design a machine learning model to detect Cyber attack in EV
### Data preprocessing:
- Check for missing or null values in the dataset and handle them appropriately (e.g. removing or imputing missing values).
- Convert categorical features into numerical values using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Scale the numerical features using standardization or normalization.

### Feature selection:
- Identify the relevant features for detecting false data injection attacks.
- Remove any redundant or irrelevant features from the dataset.

### Training the SVM model:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the SVM model on the training set.
- Tune the hyperparameters of the SVM model to obtain the best performance on the validation set.

### Evaluating the SVM model:
- Evaluate the performance of the SVM model on the testing set.
- Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the model.
- Use visualization tools to analyze the results and gain insights into the performance of the model.

In terms of applying SVM to detect false data injection attacks in the EV charging dataset, we can use the features you mentioned as follows:

- Input features: **Kwh Total, dollar, Starting time, Ending Time, Charging Time, Weekday, User Id, Station ID, and Location ID.**
- Target feature: **Session ID (since this is a unique identifier for each charging session**, we can use this to identify whether a particular session is anomalous or not).

We can use the SVM algorithm to build a binary classification model that can classify a charging session as either normal or anomalous. Anomalous charging sessions are those that have been tampered with by an attacker through false data injection.

To train the SVM model, we can use the preprocessed dataset, split it into training and testing sets, and feed the input features to the SVM model along with the target feature. The goal is to train the model to accurately predict whether a charging session is normal or anomalous based on the input features.

Once the SVM model has been trained, we can evaluate its performance on the testing set and calculate various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. If the performance is satisfactory, we can use the model to predict whether a new charging session is normal or anomalous based on its input features.

# Questions:
These are the question that are imported.
## Question 1: in the dataset there is no FalseDataInjectionAttack ?
If there is no FalseDataInjectionAttack in the dataset, then you won't be able to train a model to detect it. Without labeled data indicating which sessions are legitimate and which are not, it is not possible to train a supervised machine learning model for this task. You may need to either collect more data with known false data injection attacks or find a pre-existing dataset that includes labeled data for this type of attack. Alternatively, you can explore unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches to anomaly detection.

## Question 02: I told you the features and there is no False DataInjection Attack feature in the data set now what should I do 
If there is no labeled data for False Data Injection Attack in the dataset, you may need to explore unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches to anomaly detection. One such approach is to use clustering algorithms to identify groups of sessions that behave similarly and then use manual inspection or domain knowledge to determine if any of these groups represent false data injection attacks. Alternatively, you can try using generative models, such as autoencoders or GANs, to learn the underlying distribution of normal behavior and then identify sessions that deviate significantly from this distribution as potential attacks. However, it is important to keep in mind that these unsupervised approaches may have a higher false positive rate compared to supervised approaches using labeled data.

## Question 03: But according to research paper I need to do this using SVM, Can we use SCM with unsupervious Learning?
Yes, you can use SVM with unsupervised learning techniques such as anomaly detection to detect false data injection attacks even if you don't have labeled data for such attacks in your dataset. One approach is to use the One-Class SVM algorithm which is designed to learn the boundaries of normal data and identify anomalies outside of those boundaries.

You can train the One-Class SVM algorithm on the normal data in your dataset, and then use it to detect any instances of data that fall outside of the normal boundaries as potential false data injection attacks. This can be useful in situations where you don't have access to labeled data for the attacks, but still want to detect them based on deviations from normal patterns in the data.

## Question 04; So for this what do I need to do 
For unsupervised learning with SVM, you can use a technique called One-Class SVM. This technique is used for anomaly detection and does not require labeled data. The algorithm learns the normal patterns of the data during training and identifies deviations from the normal patterns during testing.

To use One-Class SVM, you can follow these steps:

Load the dataset and pre-process it as necessary, including one-hot encoding for categorical features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Use One-Class SVM to train the model on the training set.
Use the trained model to predict on the testing set.
Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Note that since this is an unsupervised learning approach, there won't be a specific "False DataInjection Attack" label in the dataset. Instead, the algorithm will identify outliers or anomalies that deviate from the normal patterns of the data.

## Question 05: Using this method can I predict the cyber attack 
With unsupervised learning, the model may be able to identify patterns and anomalies in the data, but it may not be able to explicitly predict the occurrence of a cyber attack. The model can flag potential instances of false data injection, but further investigation and analysis would be necessary to confirm whether it is actually a cyber attack or not.

Supervised learning may be more appropriate for predicting cyber attacks, where the model is trained on labeled data that includes instances of cyber attacks and normal activity.


## Question 06: In the research paper what was used supervious Learning or Unsupervious Learning
The research paper "Cyber-Attack on P2P Energy Transaction Between Connected Electric Vehicles: A False Data Injection Detection Based Machine Learning Model" used a supervised learning approach for detecting false data injection attacks. Specifically, they used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify whether a given transaction was genuine or was falsified due to an attack.

## Question 07: at the end of this using unsupervised learning we will be able to say that there is a chance that cyber attack has occured  
Yes, by using unsupervised learning techniques such as SVM, we can train the model to detect patterns in the data and identify any anomalies that may indicate a cyber attack. The output of the model can then be used to flag potential instances of false data injection attacks, which can then be further investigated and verified by domain experts. However, it is important to note that unsupervised learning approaches can only detect anomalies and cannot definitively confirm the presence of a cyber attack. Further analysis and investigation are needed to confirm the occurrence of a cyber attack.

## So For supervious learning we need more data, if yes then what kind of data and for unsupervious learning we don't need more data

For supervised learning, you would typically need a labeled dataset, which means that you need to have examples of both normal behavior and examples of cyber attacks. The more labeled data you have, the better your model will be able to learn to classify new instances correctly.

For unsupervised learning, you don't necessarily need labeled data, but you still need a large dataset that includes examples of normal and abnormal behavior. Unsupervised learning algorithms can help to identify patterns and anomalies in the data that might indicate the presence of a cyber attack. However, it can be challenging to interpret the results of unsupervised learning algorithms without additional context or knowledge about the system being analyzed.
