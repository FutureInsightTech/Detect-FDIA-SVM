## Explian Research paper:
The paper addresses the issue of cybersecurity in peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading between connected electric vehicles (EVs). P2P energy trading can potentially improve the efficiency of energy usage and reduce carbon emissions, but it also brings new cybersecurity challenges. In particular, there is a risk of false data injection attacks, in which an attacker injects false data into the P2P energy trading system to manipulate the energy prices or steal energy.

To address this challenge, the authors propose a machine learning-based model that uses a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between legitimate and false energy trading data. The model takes into account several features, such as the transaction time, energy amount, transaction history, number of transactions, and energy demand of the EVs involved in the transaction. These features are used to train the SVM classifier to identify patterns in the data that are indicative of false data injection attacks.

The authors tested their proposed model using a dataset of simulated P2P energy trading transactions. They injected various types of false data into the dataset and evaluated the performance of the model in detecting these attacks. The results showed that the proposed model achieved high accuracy in detecting false data injection attacks, with an average detection rate of 98.8% and a false positive rate of 0.11%.

However, the authors note that their proposed model has some limitations. For example, the model assumes that all EVs involved in the transaction are honest and that the communication channels between the EVs are secure. If an EV is compromised or the communication channels are vulnerable to attack, the model may not be effective in detecting false data injection attacks. The authors suggest that future research could explore ways to address these limitations, such as incorporating reputation-based mechanisms to identify dishonest EVs or using encryption to secure the communication channels.

Overall, the paper proposes a machine learning-based model for detecting false data injection attacks in P2P energy trading between connected EVs. The model takes into account various features to distinguish between legitimate and false energy trading data and achieves high accuracy in detecting false data injection attacks.
